Portfolio Modal HTML


This is the section where whenever you have a new video you want to showcase on your main portfolio, you must make adjusting changes.

In front of you is an example of the first modal. Modals are the content boxes that will show up on your screen, similar to lightboxes.

On the Green Highlight Boxed Text, this is where you write your Project's.

Lorem Ipsum is the Subtitle.




On the yellow highlight, this is the code to remove borders, play button and the link to transfer you to the YouTube website.



On the Blue Highlight, you will use this area for the descriptions of the video, the dates, the client, as well as the category.

If there is anything that confuses you, please don't be afraid to give me a call, a text, or email.
